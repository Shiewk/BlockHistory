# BlockHistory
A simple but effective Paper Minecraft plugin that allows you to find griefers on your server more easily.

The plugin "BlockHistory" can help you find griefers more easily. The plugin saves when a block is broken or placed. That way you can easily see who broke or placed blocks.

## Usage
Install the plugin on your server for it to be able to track blocks.

Then, if you need to view the history of a block, run **[/blockhistory](https://github.com/Shiewk/BlockHistory/blob/main/docs/commands.md)**. This will display the history of the block you're standing on. It should look like this:

![BlockHistory command chat output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f65b7ea-83ac-4474-a883-84e85844f856)

This way, you can easily see changes like someone destroying your builds etc.
